 <p>
    <ul> 
        <ls>Hello! I'm Hemnath, a dedicated full-stack developer with a strong foundation in technology.<br>
            Holding a diploma in Mechanical, I bring a mix of practical skills and a deep passion for creating<br>
            innovative solutions. My journey in tech has equipped me with a solid understanding of both front-end <br>
            and back-end development.</ls><br><br>

        <ls>Key skills in my toolkit include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and experience with frameworks like React and Node.js.<br>
            I've also worked with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, and I'm familiar with version control systems like Git. <br>
            My goal as a full-stack developer is to leverage my knowledge to build seamless, user-friendly applications while <br>
            continually learning and adapting to new technologies.</ls>

 <h3>STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR IN JAVA</h3>
    <p>
        This Java program calculates and displays a student's average grade and corresponding letter grade based on scores entered for multiple subjects.<br>
        Users input the number of subjects and their grades, and the program computes the average.<br>
        It then assigns a letter grade based on predefined thresholds (A, B, C, D, F) and outputs the results.<br>
