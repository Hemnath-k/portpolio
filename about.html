        <ls>Hello! I'm Hemnath, a dedicated full-stack developer with a strong foundation in technology.<br>
            Holding a diploma in Mechanical, I bring a mix of practical skills and a deep passion for creating<br>
            innovative solutions. My journey in tech has equipped me with a solid understanding of both front-end <br>
            and back-end development.</ls><br><br>

        <ls>Key skills in my toolkit include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and experience with frameworks like React and Node.js.<br>
            I've also worked with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, and I'm familiar with version control systems like Git. <br>
            My goal as a full-stack developer is to leverage my knowledge to build seamless, user-friendly applications while <br>
            continually learning and adapting to new technologies.</ls>
